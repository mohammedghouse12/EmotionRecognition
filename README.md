# EmotionRecognition

• Implemented a neural network using Keras, Sckit-Learn, Tensor Flow framework's and Librosa, Matplotlib libraries.
• Extracted 9 features from Temporal and Spectral plots from each sample file to to feed as test data input to the model.
• Trained model to classify an audio into 1 out of 7 emotions on basis of Nine extracted features with accuracy of 97.5%.
• Analyzed performance of model by evaluating Confusion Matrix and by plotting Training, Testing Accuracy with Batch Size
